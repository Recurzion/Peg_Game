Peg_Game
========

Java implementation of the Cracker Barrel Peg Game
Created by Lloyd Jones for ITEC-220

Uses Swing to emulate the popular Cracker Barrel "Peg Game".
Simply click on a peg to select it, then click on an empty hole jump the peg into that hole, thus removing the peg
in between from the board. Try to leave as few pegs as you can!
